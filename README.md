Delhi AQI Data Analysis and Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Delhi, India. The project follows a standard data science workflow, from data exploration to model building.

Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The notebook performs a comprehensive EDA on the Delhi AQI dataset.

Data Preprocessing: It includes steps to clean the data by dropping unnecessary columns and handling duplicate entries.

Model Building: The project utilizes the scikit-learn library to train a Logistic Regression model for predicting AQI.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy score, and a classification report.

Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation.
